# ComputerVision_CNN_PlantSeedlingClassification
### Project Summary
The goal of this project was to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify plant seedlings into their respective categories. The project involved exploring image data of various plant species, performing preprocessing to prepare the images for model input, and tuning multiple CNN architectures to improve the classification accuracy.

### Key Aspects of the Project
1. **Objective**: Develop a CNN model to accurately identify plant species based on image data, aiding in applications like automated weed detection and precision agriculture.
2. **Data**: High-resolution images of different plant species, requiring significant preprocessing and scaling.
3. **Evaluation**: The model's performance was evaluated through various metrics, with accuracy as the primary metric to gauge classification success.

### Statistical Analysis
- **Data Overview**: Initial analysis showed a balanced dataset with an even split between different plant species.
- **Visual Analysis**: Visualized pixel intensities, and examined differences in image structures among plant categories, identifying areas of potential model confusion.

### Data Processing and Model Building
- **Data Preparation**: Images were resized and scaled, and labels were one-hot encoded. The dataset was divided into training, testing, and validation subsets.
- **Model Architecture**: Multiple CNN architectures were implemented, experimenting with different convolutional and pooling layers. A VGG16-based model was also tested for transfer learning, significantly boosting accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Conducted to improve the model's generalizability, adjusting batch sizes, learning rates, and dropout rates to prevent overfitting.

### Model Selection
After testing multiple models, the VGG16-based model achieved the best performance, providing higher accuracy and generalization compared to custom CNN architectures. Model performance metrics, including precision and recall, were used to validate this selection.

### Takeaways from the Project
- **Model Performance**: The final model achieved approximately 72% accuracy on test data, suggesting room for improvement.
- **Practical Applications**: This model can streamline the plant identification process in precision agriculture and support weed detection systems.
- **Future Improvements**: The model could benefit from larger datasets, additional data augmentation, and experiments with alternative architectures.
